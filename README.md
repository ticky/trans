![Screenshot, showing Go in blue, XSLT in pink, EmberScript in off-white, Gnuplot in a slightly paler pink, and Processing in a slightly darker blue](screenshot.png)

## Testing the programs

Yes, they all at least run, some even do something!

- `stripe-1.go` was tested in [The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/p/YgsgePLPlLd)
- `stripe-2.xslt` was tested with [This XSL Transformation tool](http://www.utilities-online.info/xsltransformation/) and an XML document with at least a valid root element.
- `stripe-3.emberscript` was tested with the EmberScript editors on <emberscript.com>, and then [Ember Twiddle](https://ember-twiddle.com)
- `stripe-4.plt` was tested using `gnuplot -p stripe-4.plt`
- `stripe-5.pde` was tested using [Processing for macOS](https://processing.org)
